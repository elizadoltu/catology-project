# Catology

## Overview
Catology is a system able to classify a cat as belonging to one breed. It has the following main functionalities:

1. **Translate and add new instances in the dataset:** The dataset is available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ht5p5pg7b7/1).
2. **Read a natural language description of a cat:** Extract relevant attributes and identify its breed.
3. **Generate a natural language description of a cat breed:** This uses the trained classifiers.
4. **Generate a natural language comparison between two breeds.**

## Tasks

### 1. Modeling Task
- Perform exploratory analysis of the dataset to better understand its structure and the features that define different cat breeds.

### 2. Neural Network / Reinforcement Learning (NN/RL) Task
- Train a classifier to accurately predict a catâ€™s breed based on the available attributes in the dataset.

### 3. Knowledge Representation / Natural Language Processing (KR/NLP) Task
- Generate a natural language description of a cat breed using the trained classifiers.
- Produce a README file that explains how the classifiers work and their outputs.
